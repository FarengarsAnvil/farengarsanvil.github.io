    <h2 id= "projects">My Projects</h2>
    <p class = "Paragraphs">The purpose of this Page is to be the main showcase, explanation and summarization of the Projects that i have undertaken in my Freetime. </p>
    <p class = "Paragraphs">As of the current moment of creating this Portfolio, i am currently starting Year 2 of University, and with the knowledge that i have gained</p>
    <p class = "Paragraphs">From University lectures and my outside research, i was able to create these 3 Projects during my First year of University.</p>

    <h2 id = "PR1">Project 1: Progtimer and Blocker Mode: A Cross platform GUI Application that works as an Application Timer and a Process Blocker.</h2>  
    <a class = "link" href = "https://github.com/FarengarsAnvil/Program-Timer-and-Blocker-Mode-Disable-Distractions"><button id = "PT" class = "project-btn">Project 1 Github Link:</button></a>
    <p class = "Paragraphs">Progtimer and Blocker Mode is a cross platform utility application which gives the user the ability to set a timer for how long they use a certain program for, and once the timer has been met they are no longer able to use the application, Blocker mode is a program blocker which allows the user to add applications to a block list, which prevents them from running whilst blocker mode is active. 
        The purpose behind this utility application is to help limit distractions for the user, and facilitating them to be more productive and get some work done without the temptation of distracting applications such as Games, google, spotify etc. 
        What inspired me to build this program was my dad whom was complaining about my brother whom was using his Laptop too often for games as opposed for studying or being productive like doing research, so the thought came to my head that I could produce a piece of software that he could use to increase his productivity on his school work by removing the distractions temporarily from him. 
        Progtimer has a fully functional GUI and exe file which means it can be ran by any computer, it was all programmed in Python. 
        </p>
    <p class = "Paragraphs"> How it works is by the user choosing a program 
        that they wish to time their usage for, this is done by clicking the "Choose program" button and navigating through the FileMenu to find the .exe file for the Application that they want to time their usage for. 
        The user can enter the duration of  the timer into the text entry box. NOTE: THE TIMER IS IN MINUTES. So the number entered in the Textbox is the number of minutes you can use the Application before it is remotely stopped by Progtimer.
        For example: If i wanted to limit my usage of Chrome to one hour, so that i do not waste too much time watching youtube, i enter 60 into the Entry box, press the confirm timer button. Then i find the chrome.exe by clicking on the Select program button and then press the Start timer button. 
        Now the Progress bar on the GUI will increase as time goes on until it reaches 60 minutes when it will be filled green indicating that it has been 60 minutes, then the Application will close.</p>    

    <p class = "Paragraphs"> You open blocker mode by going to the "Options" Menubar in PROGTIMER and select the first option in the Menu, that is "Switch to Blocker Mode". This will then open a New window and close the existing one, and you will now be in Blocker Mode. 
        Then you press the "Choose Applications Button" and add all the Applications that you want. Then after having chosen all the Applications that you want disable, you press the cancel button in the Filemenu to go back to the GUI Window and then press the Start button. 
        
        
        Whenever you try to open any of the applications that you have selected to disable whilst blockmode is still open, the process will be Automatically killed. 
        You can end the Blocker Mode by simply closing the program. </p>

    <h2 id = "PR1">Project 2: Griddy: A 2D Console Pathfinding Application, utilising Depth and Breadth First Searches, and my own Recursive diagonal traversal algorithm..</h2>
    <a class = "link" href = "https://github.com/FarengarsAnvil/Griddy-2D-Pathfinder-w-DFS.-BFS-and-Recursion-traversal-Algorithm"><button id = "PT2" class = "project-btn">Project 2 Github Link:</button></a>
    <p class ="Paragraphs">This project is an applicative summarization of everything that i have learnt so far in Year 1 of University. This project deals with Object oriented Programming, it deals with graphs and graph algorithms, it deals with Recursion and i think that it is a Good display of my knowledge and my ability with Programming so far.</p>
    <p class ="Paragraphs">What is Griddy: Griddy is a Console 2D grid pathfinding program which the user sets the start, destination and obstacles on a 2D Grid, and then chooses an Algorithm to use to get from the starting point to the destination whilst avoiding the Obstacles.</p>
    <p class = "Paragraphs"> This project is still not fully completed as I would like to render the Grid and the paths produced by the algorithms, this is my next goal for the project.</p>
